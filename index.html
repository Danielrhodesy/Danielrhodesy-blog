          </div>
          <div class="blog-content-block blog-content-block-style">
            <h4>Relative</h4>
            <p>Relative is a position property that is basically relative to it self. So if the coder has it already setup in a position and they add top:10 it will move from where it would normally be. Other content cannot move like this with the properties top,right,bottom,left.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Absolute</h4>
            <p>An element with the position absolute will be relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. It can be overwritten over anywhere in the page of contents. So it is very powerful as you can place this element anywhere you want it.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Fixed</h4>
            <p>This positioning it used to be relative to the viewport, the viewport is from what screen size you are using to look at the site. And not to any other element.</p>

              <h3>My Identity and Values</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="blog2-content-block blog-content-block-style">
              <h4>Ethical situation I had to make</h4>
              <p>Although this may not relate to something I will need in my coding career it has always been a story I remember from it being a difficult decision that had to be done and was a bit humorous. My brother was around a 5 hour drive away from me as I was home and he was being mischeifious with his friends while being drunk. I get a call from the police station at 10 at night where my brother is saying he needs them to get picked up now or he would be held in the police station through the night and then our parents would find out. I had to make the decision to drive have a total of a 10 hour drive just to save him from my parents anger. But I made the journey and he was rather grateful. I guess this showed some kind of loyalty to my brother which he would repay to me.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Culture influencing my identities and values</h4>
              <p>In my high school years I was in a boarding house where I was constantly interacting with people all ages and from all different cultures them self. I think this has given me some kind of advantage with interaction with people and this helps in some of my strengths needed for this learning journey.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>My strengths and limitations</h4>
              <p>For me to evaluate my strengths and limitation in this learning journey I would have to focus on my last year of doing Web Development at Yoobee. Last year I went through a lot of self evaluation as I have seen that I wasn't strong with deadlines and that my learning in this skill was behind most people in this class. This made me focus in my strength of practice from home and alot of working with other people and gaining knowledge by listening and interacting.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Identifying strengths from my learning journey</h4>
              <p>I think working well in a team will help me in the future with this course. The course will be having multiple team exercises so I hope my own team working skills and past time practice will help my team co-operate smoothly and make our process efficient. If we encounter any kind obstacles or bugs I think with the easy processed team we could overcome any kind of problem.</p>

          <div class="blog3-content-block blog-content-block-style">
            <h4>Long Term Goal</h4>
            <p>My long term goal will be to get a position in the industry as a Front End Developer</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <p>I think of myself as an easy worker in teams as I can take directions and give them. I can help people who are behind as I have been helping people through my last courses and I enjoy it as it gives me some good revision.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Limitations</h4>
            <p>My skills I want to improve on at the moment will be public speaking, organisation and working on my self with professional interviews. I need to improve on my public speaking as i'm still not very confident talking over a lot of people without the usual strong nerves. Sometimes I lean back on my routines and get unorganised which I need to fix. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>My Commitment</h4>
            <p>My commitment will be to make the course every day when bootcamp starts and that i will try spend as much time there as I can. If I keep to this commitment I will be always engaging with other student which will give me motivation and make me stay at course to complete a lot of work. With always working with others I can practise time public speaking and leadership.
              If I need help i will always go through my routines of googling, asking a peer then asking a faculty member.

            <h3>The DOM</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="blog4-content-block blog-content-block-style">
            <h4>Differnce between HTML and CSS</h4>
            <p>Imagine if HTML is a house. A house has room furniture all solid thing which fills out this area and creates something to the user. All the header, div, body tags are all the content in this house. For this house to be pleasing and livable towards people it needs CSS which is basically the rules for the house , giving each part of the house colour and position rules to where each piece is.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Explain control flow and loops</h4>
            <p>Control flow is the scope of your order you have made in your code. It means what is going to execute in the order you have put it. In Javascript the flow goes from top to bottom. And a loop is a function witch if under the right arguments it will repeat the same function until it has exceeded the parameters you have set it to. An Analogy for this would be comparing control flow to a recipe. As you have to follow the recipe from the top to the bottom. When a loop comes up that could be you having to repeat one part of the recipe until it has told you the desired result.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Describe what the DOM</h4>
            <p>The DOM is an interface to the HTML document. It is essentially an API to the page allowing programs to read and manipulate the pages content, structure and styles. It converts the structure of the HTML to be able to be modeled by various programs. You can interact with the DOM by using javascript, as I could select, highlight or change sections in the DOM and make them have useful programs and function attaches to the different sections.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Difference between arrays and objects</h4>
            <p>Array and objects both hold data but in a different way. Arrays are more simple and hold data in a list. Like a shipping list (butter, eggs, milk, chocolate). Where objects hold data in a list but also give each data peice keys and values to those keys. Just like (butter : 100, eggs : 12) and so on.

            <h4>Explaining to a Friend</h4>
            <p>When getting stuck with a simple problem I will have to pause. Then read my error slowly and try break it down to pseudocode (Just coding but in a more readable language. After going through steps of this then I shall find the simple mistake. As I can pick up the mistake a lot easily with reading through the function. Rather then just try to go back through code over and over again.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>My Problem</h4>
            <p>I had a problem with the JS Gradebook “for loop”. This caused me to have to write this function out on paper. Then trying to rewrite it multiple times to try get the logic of it. After so much failure I knew I had to get help with someone who has experience and that could teach me of what I was missing. I learn the full logic of this kind of loop function which shall help me in the future.
            </p>
        `    <br>
            <h4>Solving Process</h4>
            <p>I shall start my error process with pseudocode which will help me to read it. Then after breaking the code down to something more readable I will try changing it and adding other factors to it to try and make the error work. Then if this causes further frustration I will try the rubber ducky method which is essentially explaining the problem to an inanimate object. While going through the error messages and logging any errors with the inspect tool. Googling the error is my step after, this step is huge and will a lot of the time sort out the error. If googling still has me in a stump I will ask help from my peers or someone with alo of experience such as a tutor or the facilitators. After the error has been resolved i will mainly try and repeat the function to myself or the code. So that I learn it and it sinks in.</p>

          <div class="blog6-content-block blog-content-block-style">
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>
              If people understand these benefits and practice them , they will benefit greatly in their own skills and also help their physical brain if it may have any kind of disabilities.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>My own Benefits</h4>
            <p>
              For me, Neuroplasticity could benefit me greatly with repeat practise and using my mind as one of the main tools. Such as my recent problems with some “for loops”, I have had some difficulties. With what i have learnt with Neuroplasticity I shall just focus on completing these tasks and just repeating them with my mental and physical.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Increase Neuroplasticity</h4>
            <p>
                For some ways to increase this skill. Will be attempting to mould my brain to be able to give me some intense mental time for thinking and planning out my decision in coding and also any part of life. With some meditation and practicing some of my skills just mentally will help a lot.

            <h3>Mind Growth</h3>
            <br>
            <h4>What is Mind Growth</h4>
            <p>
              Mind Growth is what you want to be adapting in your brain as it is when you want to seek a challenge, it is when you want to accomplish a goal and then go even further. Mind Growth in this field is so relevant as it makes you want to go the extra step and also not be afraid of any challenging tasks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What surprised me</h3>
            <p>
              I was surprised but how this is not something you're born with. It's something you can just switch to and train your brain to think like this. With creating a mind that can grow I am not as scared of some challenges as i know i can get over them soon enough.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How I incorporate this into my learning</h3>
            <p>
              With any new challenges that do scare me and seem difficult I must not take it as a defeat straight away. I must picture this tasks as i new learning experience and growth. Anything I don't know then I should prepare myself for learning the task and improving myself.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              I enjoy this article as it shows what the differences between Fixed and Growth is. With the Benefits greatly showing on the growth side.
