          </div>
          <div class="blog-content-block blog-content-block-style">
            <h4>Relative</h4>
            <p>Relative is a position property that is basically relative to it self. So if the coder has it already setup in a position and they add top:10 it will move from where it would normally be. Other content cannot move like this with the properties top,right,bottom,left.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Absolute</h4>
            <p>An element with the position absolute will be relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. It can be overwritten over anywhere in the page of contents. So it is very powerful as you can place this element anywhere you want it.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Fixed</h4>
            <p>This positioning it used to be relative to the viewport, the viewport is from what screen size you are using to look at the site. And not to any other element.</p>

              <h3>My Identity and Values</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="blog2-content-block blog-content-block-style">
              <h4>Ethical situation I had to make</h4>
              <p>Although this may not relate to something I will need in my coding career it has always been a story I remember from it being a difficult decision that had to be done and was a bit humorous. My brother was around a 5 hour drive away from me as I was home and he was being mischeifious with his friends while being drunk. I get a call from the police station at 10 at night where my brother is saying he needs them to get picked up now or he would be held in the police station through the night and then our parents would find out. I had to make the decision to drive have a total of a 10 hour drive just to save him from my parents anger. But I made the journey and he was rather grateful. I guess this showed some kind of loyalty to my brother which he would repay to me.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Culture influencing my identities and values</h4>
              <p>In my high school years I was in a boarding house where I was constantly interacting with people all ages and from all different cultures them self. I think this has given me some kind of advantage with interaction with people and this helps in some of my strengths needed for this learning journey.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>My strengths and limitations</h4>
              <p>For me to evaluate my strengths and limitation in this learning journey I would have to focus on my last year of doing Web Development at Yoobee. Last year I went through a lot of self evaluation as I have seen that I wasn't strong with deadlines and that my learning in this skill was behind most people in this class. This made me focus in my strength of practice from home and alot of working with other people and gaining knowledge by listening and interacting.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Identifying strengths from my learning journey</h4>
              <p>I think working well in a team will help me in the future with this course. The course will be having multiple team exercises so I hope my own team working skills and past time practice will help my team co-operate smoothly and make our process efficient. If we encounter any kind obstacles or bugs I think with the easy processed team we could overcome any kind of problem.</p>
